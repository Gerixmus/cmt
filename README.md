`sg` is a command line tool that simplifies common `git` workflows.

## SSH Authentication

`sg` utilizes SSH keys retrieved from the system's SSH agent for authentication. Currently, HTTPS authentication is not supported.

For more information on setting up SSH keys and the SSH agent, refer to the official GitHub documentation: [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
